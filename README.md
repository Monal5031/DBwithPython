# DBwithPython
A repo meant for keeping all the things I learnt about Databases with python.
This repo contains some nice examples of python code which can be used
while working with rate-limited APIs or services.


### Usage
Open the project's DB files in a SQLite browser or something similar to
see things work properly.
